# mobile-flashcards

**Udacity React Nanodegree project 3/3.**

This "Mobile Flashcards" project is a react native app that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

The app has only been tested on Android using a physical Pixel 3 device and the [Expo Client App](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app#usage-with-expo-client-app).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app).

To run this project:

- install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
- `yarn start` -- (`expo start`) Start the Metro Bundler (recommended)

- `yarn ios` -- (`react-native run-ios`) Build the iOS App (requires a MacOS computer)
