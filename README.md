# mobile-flashcards

**Udacity React Nanodegree project 3/3.**

This "Mobile Flashcards" project is a react native app that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo](https://expo.io/) and its [managed workflow](https://docs.expo.io/introduction/managed-vs-bare/#managed-workflow) (TypeScript).

To run this project:

- install all project dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`
- start the development server with `yarn start` or `npm start`
